# makeup_store
Makeup store iOS app developed in Swift. Data fetched from https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/, due to unreliability of the up-time of the server the current app fetches the data from a JSON file.

# The API
Currently the API only does a GET call. Hence, the submitting of an order is mocked to trigger a success order page.

# Pre-requisites
1. Xcode
2. Kingfisher as a dependency

If for some reason Kingfisher is uninstalled in the project please install either using Cocoapods or Swift package manager.
